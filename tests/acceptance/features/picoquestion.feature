Feature: Chair Can Manage Pico Questions

  As an Domain Chair / Co-Chair,
  I can create a PICO question to be answered, containing:
  - Patient type and condition (two entity reference fields)
  - Intervention (text area)
  - Comparator (Text Area)
  - Outcome (Entity Reference)
  - Search Strategy (search query string)
  - Evidence Evaluator ()
  - Information Specialist ()
  - Comments
  So that we may collect data on various research around a structured topic with clear variables and objectives
